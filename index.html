                    <h3>These metrics describe various aspects of a song:</h3>
                    <p> üíÉ Danceability:<br>This measures how suitable a track is for dancing. It is determined by tempo, rhythm stability, 
                        beat strength, and overall regularity. Higher danceability means the track is more danceable.
                    </p>
                    <p> üòÅ Valence:<br>This describes the musical ‚Äúpositivity‚Äù conveyed by a track. High valence sounds more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), 
                        while low valence indicates a more negative sound (sad, angry, depressed).
                    </p>
                    <p> ‚ö° Energy:<br>A measure of intensity and activity. High-energy tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy, while low-energy tracks feel more calm and relaxed. 
                        It's based on factors like tempo, dynamic range, and perceived loudness.
                    </p>
                    <p> üéª Acousticness:<br>This measures the extent to which a track is acoustic. 
                        A value close to 1.0 means the song is highly acoustic, while values closer to 0.0 mean it is more electronic or synthetic.
                    </p>
                    <p> üôä Instrumentalness:<br>This predicts the likelihood of a track being purely instrumental, without vocals. Higher values suggest fewer or no vocals, 
                        while lower values indicate that the song is more likely to have lyrics.
                    </p>
                    <p> üì∫ Liveness:<br>This detects the presence of an audience in a track, suggesting the likelihood that the track was recorded live. 
                        Higher values mean the song feels more like a live performance.
                    </p>
                    <p> üì£ Speechiness:<br>This measures the presence of spoken words in a track. High speechiness suggests a spoken-word piece (like a podcast or poetry), 
                        while lower values are associated with traditional singing.</p>
